|  [Amazon EC2 dedicated hosts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/dedicated-hosts-overview.html) – Use your existing per\-socket, per\-core, or per\-VM software licenses, including Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, SUSE, and Linux Enterprise Server\.  |  Launch Amazon EC2 instances into host resource groups to help maximize your utilization of Dedicated Hosts\. For more information, see [Working with dedicated hosts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/how-dedicated-hosts-work.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances\.*  | 
| [Amazon EC2 capacity reservations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-capacity-reservations.html) – Reserve capacity for your Amazon EC2 instances to be used when you need it\. You can specify attributes for the capacity reservation so that it only works with Amazon EC2 instances that launch with matching attributes\. |  Launch your Amazon EC2 instances into resource groups that contain one or more capacity reservations\. If the group doesn't have a capacity reservation with matching attributes and available capacity for a requested instance, the instance runs as an on\-demand instance\. If you later add a matching capacity reservation to the targeted group, the instance is automatically matched with and moved into the reserved capacity\. For more information, see [Work with Capacity Reservation groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/capacity-reservations-using.html#create-cr-group) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances\.*  | 
|  [AWS License Manager](/license-manager/latest/userguide/license-manager.html) – Streamline the process of bringing software vendor licenses to the cloud\.  |  Configure a host resource group to enable License Manager to manage your Dedicated Hosts\.

|  [AWS Service Catalog App Registry](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/latest/adminguide/appregistry.html) – Define and manage your applications and their metadata\.  |  When you create an application in AWS Service Catalog App Registry, that service automatically creates an resource group for that application\. The application resource group is a collection of all of the resources in your application\. The service also creates a AWS CloudFormation stack\-based resource group for every stack associated with the application\. For more information, see [Using AppRegistry](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/latest/adminguide/appregistry.html) in the *AWS Service Catalog Administrator Guide*\.  |
