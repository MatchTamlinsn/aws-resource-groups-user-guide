# Customizing Tag Search Results<a name="customizing-tag-search-results"></a>

After completing a search, you can sort and filter the results of your tag search to find the tags and resources that you need to work with\.

**To customize tag search results**  
Do any of the following:

+ To limit the display to resources that contain a keyword, type the keyword in the filter box above the table\. For example, you could type **elasticbeanstalk** to see all resources whose ID indicates that they are associated with the Elastic Beanstalk service\.

   

+ To sort the list by any column, choose the column heading name\. To reverse the sort order, choose the name again\.

   

+ To change the width of a table column, drag the divider between the column headings\.

   

+ To add or remove columns of existing tag keys to the results, choose the cog icon \(![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/images/rg-cog-ico.png)\) above the table and select or deselect a tag key\. To search for and limit what items appear in the list, type a full or partial keyword or words in the box at the top\.
