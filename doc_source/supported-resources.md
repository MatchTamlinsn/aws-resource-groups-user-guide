## Supported Resources for Resource Groups<a name="supported-resources-console"></a>

You can use the Resource Groups tool in the AWS Management Console to create groups for the following tagged AWS resources\.

**Important**  
A resource group based on a query for **All supported resource types** can add members automatically over time, as new resources are supported by Resource Groups\. When you run automations or other bulk tasks on an existing resource group based on **All supported resource types**, be aware that the actions might be run on many more resources than were in the group when you first created it\. This might also mean that automations or tasks that you created for other resources are applied to unintended resources, or resources on which the tasks cannot be completed\.
