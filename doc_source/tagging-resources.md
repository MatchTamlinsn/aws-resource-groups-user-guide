# Tagging Resources<a name="tagging-resources"></a>

After you have located the resources that you want to tag, you can add, remove, or edit the tags for all or some of your search results as a group\.

To apply a new tag to one or more resources, you begin by creating a tag key\.

**To create a tag key**

1. Search for the resources whose tags you want to manage\.

1. Choose **Create a new tag key**\.

1. Type the name of your new key, and then choose **Add key**\. Repeat for as many tag keys as you want to create\.
**Note**  
The new tag key does not actually exist until a value for the new key is applied to a resource\. A tag does not exist unless it is applied to a resource\.

**To edit or apply tags for a single resource**

1. Search for the resources whose tags you want to manage\.

1. Customize the search results table to make it easy to find the resource that you want\.

1. Do any of the following:

   + To add a tag to a resource, choose the **\+** \(![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/images/rg-plus-ico.png)\) icon, type a value, and choose the check mark icon \(![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/images/rg-check-ico.png)\)\. You can apply a tag to a resource without specifying a value\.

      

   + To edit the tag value of a resource, choose the pencil icon \(![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/images/rg-pencil-ico.png)\) by its value and edit the value\. Choose the check mark icon or press **Enter**\.

      

   + To remove an existing tag value, choose the **X** icon \(![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/images/rg-x-ico.png)\) next to the value\.

      

   + To apply an existing tag key, choose the cog icon \(![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/images/rg-cog-ico.png)\) and select the key that you want, as explained in [Customizing Tag Search Results](customizing-tag-search-results.md)\. Then choose the **\+** icon in the column for that key, type a new value, and either choose the check mark icon or press **Enter**\.

      

   + To modify a resource’s tag in its own console, choose the blue icon \(![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/images/rg-manage-ico.png)\)\. Then use the settings in that console to edit or apply tags\.

**To edit or apply tags for multiple resources**
